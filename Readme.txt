This repository is an example of test-driven development.

Test driven devlopment is a coding theory used mostly in theory and academia
and very rarely in practice. The main reason for that is its strength lies in the
rigidity of its requirements. If the requirements constantly change, this
type of development is a complete waste of time.

Most people think - oh, it's a program. I know, I'll write 500 lines of code and then debug.
The idea behind this kind of development is you think about what each function does and 
write test cases for it. You then write code to match it. With this in mind, you make sure
each function is doing what it should do, and therefore it's super easy to debug.

The problem with this is if your thoughts are wrong. That's why it's always important to 
keep in mind, it's a soft guarantee. If there's a bug when the regression test is run, it
means there's an issue with your conceptual knowledge - that's when it's time to ask for
help. 

In all seriousness, creating test cases should take approx 10 minutes. Writing code
approx 30-40 minutes. It's important to finish as soon as possible because
if there's a bug, you will need to get help as soon as possible. 

Note: I don't know why professors don't leacture on it despite
giving people tests to run their code against all the time.
